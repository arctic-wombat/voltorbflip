      <p>
        This is a recreatation of the Voltorb Flip game that appears in the
        Korean and Western releases of Pok√©mon HeartGold and SoulSilver. The
        game is a mix between Minesweeper and Picture Cross and the placement of
        the bombs are given for each row and column. The goal of the game is to
        uncover all of the 2 and 3 tiles on a given board and move up to higher
        levels which have higher coin totals.
      </p>
      <p>
        The numbers on the side and bottom of the game board denote the sum of
        the tiles and how many bombs are present in that row/column,
        respectively. Each tile you flip multiplies your collected coins by that
        value. Once you uncover all of the 2 and 3 tiles, all of the coins you
        gained this level will be added to your total and you'll go up one level
        to a max of 7. If you flip over a Voltorb, you lose all your coins from
        the current level and risk going down to a lower level.
